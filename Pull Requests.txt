A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project. It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed version control system (DVCS) such as Git. A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.

It is important to note that “pull requests” are a workflow method, and are not a feature of the version control system itself. This document will provide a simple overview of pull requests and how they are created, using the Git version control system and GitHub hosting site as examples.
